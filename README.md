**1. LDA(Linear discriminant analysis)** -  normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.

**2. LRG(Logistic regression)** -  a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

3. Regression
4. k-decision tree
5. Naive Baye Classifer
6. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Natural Language Processing 

Word processing: 
  - make use of NLTK package to clean sentences, remove stopword, stemming, lemanization
  - read_file_df: take csv input and reutrn dataframe with cleaned data.
  - options to use feature extraction method either Bag of Word, n_gram and tf_idf.

Image Processing
 
 - load and read pickle file
 - detect and crop the main objects off each picture
 - combine objects and make a feature rich image
 - write process data to a new pickle file
